In water they are sometimes collectively known as a ‘flock’ or a ‘waddle’ of ducklings.\n\nBaby ducks imprint shortly after birth. Imprinting is essentially when a duckling programs itself to follow one guardian (it’s mother) based on the first large moving object that it sees.\n\nDucklings usually imprint in the first few hours of life - 12 to 36 hours after birth. This stage is known as the ‘sensitive’ or ‘critical stage’."
